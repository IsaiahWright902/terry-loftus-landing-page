                His family moved from Seattle to Idaho when he was 12 for his
                father’s new job as a Superintendent doing sewer and water work
                all around Boise. He grew up listening to his dad and friends
                discussing best practices in that line of work. Terry began
                working in that industry at the age of 20 until completing an

                at Boise State and going to work at Hewlett-Packard.
